MindMate AI Assistant

### *1. Project Report (PDF)*  
*Sections*:  
1. *Introduction*  
   - *Problem Statement*: Mental health support is often inaccessible, expensive, or stigmatized.  
   - *Objective*: Develop an AI-driven assistant to provide personalized mental health guidance, mood tracking, and stress management using NLP and machine learning.  

2. *Technical Approach*  
   - *Methodology*: Agile workflow with iterative development.  
   - *Tools*: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for ML models), Flask (backend), React (frontend), PostgreSQL (database).  
   - *Frameworks*: spaCy/NLTK for NLP, Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis.  

3. *Development Process*  
   - *Phase 1*: Data collection (public datasets like Reddit mental health threads).  
   - *Phase 2*: Model training (sentiment analysis, stress detection).  
   - *Phase 3*: API integration and UI design.  
   - *Phase 4*: User testing and feedback loops.  

4. *Outcomes and Results*  
   - Achieved 85% accuracy in sentiment analysis.  
   - Users reported 30% improvement in mood after 2 weeks of use.  

5. *Challenges and Solutions*  
   - *Challenge*: Data privacy concerns.  
     *Solution*: Implemented end-to-end encryption for user chats.  
   - *Challenge*: Model overfitting.  
     *Solution*: Added dropout layers and augmented training data.  

6. *Future Improvements*  
   - Integrate wearable device data (e.g., heart rate) for stress prediction.  
   - Expand multilingual support.


### *4. Final Presentation Slides (PPT/PDF)*  
*Slides Outline*:  
1. *Title Slide*: MindMate AI Assistant – Bridging Mental Health Gaps with AI.  
2. *Problem & Rationale*: Stats on mental health accessibility gaps.  
3. *Workflow*:  
   - ERD diagram (Users, Sessions, Chatlogs, MoodEntries).  
   - System architecture (User → Flask API → ML Model → React UI).  
4. *Demo Snapshot*: GIF/video snippet of the chatbot.  
5. *Challenges*: Data bias, latency in real-time responses.  
6. *Future Vision*: AI therapist certification, gamification.
